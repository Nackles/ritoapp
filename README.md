# App in Development
WTF KILLED ME? (And How Do I Counter That?) - A lightweight overlay for death recaps that will be community tips on how to deal with certain champions and matchups. If you find yourself screaming "WTF KILLED ME?" and want to know how to fight it, just hit the "WTF" key and view general champion weaknesses plus specific tips for your matchup.

The app will be kept up-to-date with tips through community involvement, not patch notes scraping. If an update gets pushed and a champion gets changed, we'll mark it as "New as of x day" so that people will know the data is old.
